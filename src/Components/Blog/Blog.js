          What are the different ways to manage a state in a React application?
        </h1>
        <p className="font-general font-medium mt-4 mb-4">
          1. Use Reactâ€™s built-in state management features - React provides two built-in features
          for managing state, the useState() hook and the useReducer() hook, which are designed to
          make it easy to manage state within a React application.
          <br />
          2. Use a state management library such as Redux - Redux is a popular state management
          library that makes it easy to keep track of application state and dispatch actions to
          update state.
          <br />
          3. Use MobX - MobX is another popular state management library that is designed to be more
          lightweight than Redux.
          <br />
          4. Use a custom global state object - This approach involves creating a global object to
          store state, and then updating the state when needed.

          How does prototypical inheritance work?
        </h1>
        <p className="font-general font-medium mt-4 mb-4">
          Prototypical inheritance is a type of object-oriented programming in which classes are not
          present. Instead of a class, an object can inherit properties from another object. It
          works by creating an object, known as the prototype, and then making any number of copies
          of the prototype object. Any changes made to the prototype object are then inherited by
          all of the objects that have been copied from it. This can be a great way to reduce the
          amount of code needed to create complex objects.

          What is a unit test? Why should we write unit tests?
        </h1>
        <p className="font-general font-medium mt-4 mb-4">
          A unit test is a way of testing the functionality of a specific part of an application,
          such as a single function. Unit tests are designed to verify that the code is performing
          as expected. They are typically written by the developers, and help to ensure that the
          code does what it is supposed to do and that any changes do not introduce unexpected
          behavior. Writing unit tests also helps to improve the design and structure of the code,
          making it more maintainable.

        <h1 className="text-2xl font-[600] font-general mt-8">React vs. Angular vs. Vue?</h1>
        <p className="font-general font-medium mt-4 mb-4">
          React, Angular, and Vue are all popular JavaScript-based frameworks used for developing
          web applications. All three frameworks have different approaches to web development that
          can make them suitable for different projects.
          <br />
          <br />
          React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook
          and is used to create large, complex web applications. React is best suited for web
          applications that require frequent updates and changes. The library provides a way to
          create components and manage their state, making it easier to create complex, interactive
          applications.
          <br />
          <br />
          Angular is a full-fledged framework for creating web applications. It is maintained by
          Google and is used to create scalable applications with minimal coding. Angular provides a
          powerful and flexible architecture that allows developers to create complex web
          applications with a minimum of effort.
          <br />
          <br />
          Vue is a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It is maintained
          by an independent open-source community and is used to create lightweight, fast
          applications. Vue is best suited for web applications that require a simple, lightweight
          architecture.
          <br />
          <br />
          In summary, React, Angular, and Vue are all popular JavaScript frameworks for web
          development. Each framework has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the best choice for
          any particular project will depend on the complexity
